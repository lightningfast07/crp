This week, I focused on the preprocessing file for the new machine learning model and added the retrain logic. We had a connect session with Kunal and Sandesh on Wednesday, during which we received feedback for modifications. I worked on creating the backend routes for model selection and changeid prediction, implemented dynamic model loading in the backend, and added options for choosing the model. Additionally, users can now either enter a change ID or upload an Excel sheet to get the output.
