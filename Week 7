This week, I focused on creating Swagger documentation for our API endpoints and developing test suites for unit test cases for our Flask routes. I also initiated the creation of the presentation for our upcoming demo. Most of the documents are prepared, and we have successfully pushed the code to Kunal's repository. Looking ahead to next week, we will finalize our presentation and practice for the final demo.
