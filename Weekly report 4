This week, we had a meeting with our mentors to discuss the crucial features in our dataset and the various techniques we can employ for data extraction. I created UML diagrams for the model, contributing to our design documents. Additionally, I fixed several bugs on the login page of our frontend and addressed issues with our SHAP model in the backend. We have one remaining feature to implement in our model, which will enable it to learn from ongoing changes. We plan to tackle this next week.
