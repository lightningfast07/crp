# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Release Success Predictor

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive description of the "Release Success Predictor" project. This document details the functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, design constraints, and external interface requirements to ensure the successful development and deployment of the system.

#### 1.2 Scope
The "Release Success Predictor" aims to predict the success rate of change requests made within a software development lifecycle. The system will utilize historical data, including change requests, incidents, problem tickets, emergency tickets, and expedited tickets. By analyzing ongoing changes, the system will recommend additional scrutiny for change requests with a predicted success rate below 80%.

- Provide recommendations for additional scrutiny if the predicted success rate is below 80%.
- Identify and explain the factors causing potential issues in change requests.

#### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Developers**: Require insights into the success rates of their change requests.
- **Project Managers**: Need to oversee the success rates of all change requests and ensure project quality.
- **Quality Assurance Teams**: Use the predictor to identify and mitigate risks associated with change requests.

#### 2.4 Operating Environment
- The system will run on cloud infrastructure.
- It will interface with existing change management tools and databases.
- Accessible via web browsers and RESTful APIs.

#### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Ensure no data leakage between training and test data.
- Maintain high availability and scalability.
- Adhere to data privacy and security regulations.

#### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

- Users have access to the necessary credentials to view and interact with the predictor.

### 3. Specific Requirements

#### 3.1 Functional Requirements
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - The system must ingest historical data, including change requests, incidents, problem tickets, emergency tickets, and expedited tickets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - The system must perform EDA to identify relevant features impacting the success rate of change requests.

3. **Prediction Model**
   - The system must build and train a machine learning model to predict the success rate of change requests.
   - Ensure no data leakage between training and test datasets.

4. **Prediction Output**
   - Display the predicted success rate of individual change requests.
   - Display the predicted success rate of a set of change requests.
   - Categorize predictions into Green (>80%), Yellow (60-80%), and Red (<60%).

5. **Recommendations**
   - Provide recommendations for additional scrutiny if the predicted success rate is below 80%.

6. **Explanation Module**
   - Explain the factors contributing to the predicted success rate and highlight areas causing potential issues.

7. **Visualization**
   - Use visualizations to display prediction metrics and the impact of features on the success rate.

#### 3.2 Performance Requirements
- The system should provide predictions with at least 90% accuracy.
- Response time for predictions should be under 2 seconds.

#### 3.3 Logical Database Requirements
- Store historical and ongoing change request data.
- Store prediction results and model metadata.

#### 3.4 Design Constraints
- Utilize scalable cloud-based architecture.
- Ensure compatibility with major web browsers.

#### 3.5 Software System Attributes
- **Security**: Implement data encryption and secure access controls.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability with minimal downtime.

- Provide periodic reports to stakeholders on the performance and impact of the predictor.

### 6. Expectation and User Stories

#### 6.1 User Stories
1. **As a Developer**, I want to see the success rate of a single change request so that I can understand the risk associated with my change.
2. **As a Project Manager**, I want to see the success rate of a set of change requests to ensure the overall project quality.
3. **As a QA Team Member**, I want the change requests categorized based on success rate (Green, Yellow, Red) to prioritize my testing efforts.
4. **As a Project Manager**, I want the system to recommend additional scrutiny for change requests with a success rate below 80% to mitigate potential risks.
5. **As a Developer**, I want an explanation of what part of the change request is causing the issue so that I can address it effectively.
