This week, I created the Flask backend route for the prediction model and tested it using Postman. I also designed and coded the frontend results page to display predictions and a feature importance bar graph. During our weekly review with Kunal and Sandesh, we identified redundant features in our model, highlighting the need for feature extraction. Next week, we aim to perform feature extraction and explore additional algorithms to further tune our model.
